He sets the tone. The intensity of his gaze, its color and its place determine the tone of the canvas. An essential element of his work, the eye which “looks at itself” is one of the keys to the artist's universe. He is one of the crucial elements of the story he tells. Its hypnotic power calls out to us spectators. Oval, spherical, oblong, angular, tapered… whatever its shape, the eye is the open window through which we are invited to enter the canvas and to open up to our own imagination. This eye is profane and sacred, ancestral and primitive, primordial and symbolic.

Exploring the mail-art, she sent filters to the addresses of the invitees who, for confirmation, had to send back this same filter to her. They are today the trace of this event, of this ceremony which took place. Later, in 2014, she re-used the coffee filters for personal creations. By play, she diverts the used coffee filter, intended for the trash, which she ennobles and frames. The shape of the filter recalls the fan that is customary in China to decorate. She thus enjoys the teaching she received in traditional painting, noble in essence, which she projects onto a humble material.

Ses cheveux imprégnés d’encre de Chine tracent des caractères géants sur une toile monumentale, son corps devient un pinceau.

“Femme”; “On naît froissé, on meurt froissé”; “Encre Noire”; “Émotion”, ”Peace“… sont les intitulés de quelques unes de ses performances de la série “Cheveux d’Encre”, à chaque fois, réalisées devant ou entourées d’un nombreux public (plusieurs centaines voire plusieurs milliers).

Pour chaque performance, elle confectionne une nouvelle robe blanche en satin qui sera, à l’issue, tâchée d’encre. Le passage du blanc au noir garde la trace de l’éphémère. Chaque performance devient un exercice rituel, chaque oeuvre est pour elle une occasion de métamorphose et de réincarnation.

For each performance, she makes a new white satin dress which will be stained with ink afterwards. The transition from white to black keeps track of the ephemeral. Each performance becomes a ritual exercise, each work is for her an opportunity for metamorphosis and reincarnation.

MUR ... 2013 

This series started in 2013 under the title "Wall ... Wall ... When the walls speak ...". It follows a trip to New York, a vibrant, colorful and illuminated city where Olivier likes to recharge his batteries regularly. Inspired by all the differences and the cultural mix of the “Big Apple”, this series seeks the balance between light and shadow, vertical and horizontal, order and disorder, negative and positive. All these disparities and oppositions mean that each canvas has its own harmony and gives off a unique sensation.

MUR ... 2013 

This series started in 2013 under the title "Wall ... Wall ... When the walls speak ...". It follows a trip to New York, a vibrant, colorful and illuminated city where Olivier likes to recharge his batteries regularly. Inspired by all the differences and the cultural mix of the “Big Apple”, this series seeks the balance between light and shadow, vertical and horizontal, order and disorder, negative and positive. All these disparities and oppositions mean that each canvas has its own harmony and gives off a unique sensation.

A recurring character returns in several paintings to create correspondences. 

Most of the works were painted with acrylics, inks, Posca and collages.

During my solo exhibition "Akkanobi", in 2017, at the Superposition gallery in Lyon, I had proposed a series of customized bombs and a work on wood with a bottle of customized Krink ink in order to create a link between this exhibition in gallery and my intervention in rue Longue where I had painted most of the walls for a week. I have made hundreds of customizations of bombs and, from time to time, I offer "Ready-Made 2.0" where I stage objects related to this urban universe.

When I first started to show my work I joined a local art group called Untitled Nashville an all volunteer art organization who would put on 4 or 5 pop up shows a year. One show a year was the Glow (black light theme) show. Every year I entered I used a different material such as gaffers tape, zip ties, test tube shot glasses and string. After seeing some of art in another show at the gallery the owner of the Main Street Gallery suggested we do an all black light show. So we planned a Benefit “Gleam, An Illuminated Art Show” for the Nashville Classical Charter School using my black lights artworks. I also made hand painted black light masks for people to buy and wear.

One show a year was the Glow (black light theme) show. Every year I entered, I used a different material such as gaffers tape, zip ties, test tube shot glasses and string. After seeing some of art in another show at the gallery, the owner of the Main Street Gallery suggested we do an all black light show.

I also made hand painted black light masks for people to buy and wear.

This series of work was inspired by vintage skateboards of the 1950’s and 1960’s. This skateboard is hand cut and shaped out of a solid pine board. I started this project in 2009 and the series was completed in 2019. Crooked Cross 2014 9” x 32” acrylic on wood skateboard is also part of my glow series. When I first started to show my work I joined a local art group called Untitled Nashville an all volunteer art organization who would put on 4 or 5 pop up shows a year. One show a year was the Glow (black light theme) show. Every year I entered, I used a different material such as gaffers tape, zip ties, test tube shot glasses and string. After seeing some of art in another show at the gallery the owner of the Main Street Gallery suggested we do an all black light show. So we planned a Benefit “Gleam, An Illuminated Art Show” for the Nashville Classical Charter School using my black lights artworks. I also made hand painted black light masks for people to buy and wear.

When I first started to show my work I joined a local art group called Untitled Nashville an all volunteer art organization who would put on 4 or 5 pop up shows a year.
One show a year was the Glow (black light theme) show.
Every year I entered I used a different material such as gaffers tape, zip ties, test tube shot glasses and string. After seeing some of art in another show at the gallery the owner of the Main Street Gallery suggested we do an all black light show. So we planned a Benefit “Gleam, An Illuminated Art Show” for the Nashville Classical Charter School using my black lights artworks.
I also made hand painted black light masks for people to buy and wear. This series was completed in 2014.

When I first started to show my work I joined a local art group called Untitled Nashville an all volunteer art organization who would put on 4 or 5 pop up shows a year. One show a year was the Glow (black light theme) show. Every year I entered I used a different material such as gaffers tape, zip ties, test tube shot glasses and string. After seeing some of art in another show at the gallery the owner of the Main Street Gallery suggested we do an all black light show. So we planned a Benefit “Gleam, An Illuminated Art Show” for the Nashville Classical Charter School using my black lights artworks. I also made hand painted black light masks for people to buy and wear.

Nov 2020

Mixed media composition on 30x30x0.5 cm canvas board in which a vintage model is placed on a composition by Piet Mondriaan.

"The works of Piet Mondriaan seem flawless. But when you have a close look at one of his original works you are gripped with emotion just because of the flaws."

In 'No One's Perfect" the artist's search for harmony shows the beauty of 'Any One' or 'Any Body' right within these imperfections.
