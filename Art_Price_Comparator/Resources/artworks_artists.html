In 2000, she set up her raku and earthenware workshop in the Hautes Pyrénées.Pascual's work focuses on the variation of forms such as a drop of water, the ovoid and the conic. It is her objective to always keep creating and making new collections. The idea of transmitting the evolution of these forms and the stories that flow from within, often leads to revisiting the technical aspect of design, which is a perpetual questioning.Since 2010 Laure Pascual has called the Gironde region her home and has set up a new workshop. Returning to the sources has allowed her to be a guest speaker at several fine art workshops in Bordeaux. For her, creation and pedagogy are two in the same.</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>Manon Perrier was born in Sarlat (24) on September 24, 1987 and Alexandre Guilmart in Angers (49) on May 4, 1984. Young artists have an atypical and complementary artistic background.
Manon comes from a family of creative craftsmen, which led her to design herself very early on. Born in a natural setting, she divides her life between her love of horses and her passion for art. Versatile and self-taught artist, she made a living from her creations (earth sculpture, cement, painting and live performance) for 10 years, before learning to weld.
Alex has been passionate about drawing since childhood. After studying comics at the Pivaut school in Nantes, he traveled through as many cities as he exercised professions (Croupier, magician, illustrator, tattoo artist) before discovering sculpture near his hometown.
Then one day, the future couple meet: Alex participates in a sculpture project with a collective, Manon is exhibiting at that time. Then Manon teaches Alex how to weld and Alex enters Manon's universe. From then on, they never leave each other.
For 3 years, they create relentlessly, feeding on each other; their creativity explodes. They develop an original and unique approach to metal, diverting tools to serve their practice. They mix their ideas and their knowledge until they become one. They very quickly sign their works "Alex & Manon" without distinction.
Curious about everything, their subjects are varied, the vast theme of nature nevertheless emerges as the common thread of their inspiration.</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>Norman Gekko is an artist who likes to parody the hypocrisy and excesses of Western culture. Most often, Gekko produces his works in series (series of "Beehives", "Dead planet" or "Choking hazard"). Gekko’s work contrasts with the modern world’s concern for material accumulation and the incessant assault on information, images, sounds and other stimuli that paralyze and impotent our psychological self. preferring to remain incognito, contemporary artist Norman Gekko swims against the current of "sharing" on social networks and the egotistical exhibitionism that dominates contemporary art. so, no nationality, no sex. For the artist, the choice of anonymity has only one function: to allow works to be contemplated without prejudice, thus giving them their rightful place in society. Gekko’s style is clear and simple: to create, through the trompe-l’oeil technique, a unique pictorial motif on a recurring monochrome background. The sculptures, although often seemingly playful, always provoke and strike visually, once you have seen a work by Norman Gekko, you cannot confuse it with another.</td>

From informal art to abstraction
Born in Rome, Monica Sarandrea has devoted herself to drawing and in particular, to landscape painting. After several stays in Paris from 2005 to 2010, she enroled in classes taught by Alberto Parres at La Porta Blu Art School.
Sarandrea has worked with chromatic and gesture painting, gradually moving towards informal art and abstraction. From 2011, she has devoted herself to sculpture, focusing on materials such as stone, clay and plaster.
Creating a dialogue between nature and its elements
Monica Sarandrea’s works are the result of a dialogue with nature and its elements, in particular, water and land, which are intimately linked to femininity. This research evokes a certain biomorphism, halfway between the animal world and that of human beings.

<td class='normal' valign='top'>Through his paintings, artist Vincent Bardou presents us with a vision of his own world. With a unique and audacious style that can be constituted as a mix of Pop Art and Street Art, he paitns subjects such as Che Gevara, Darth Vador, Pablo Picasso, Nelson Mandela and Mickey, each with its own message waiting to be received by the viewer. These messages usually concern a current event or situation or are a tribute to an individual.
Portraits that convey a message
Vincent Bardou began drawing at the age of six. From the beginning, he was influenced by the urban environment and its expression. This inspiration led him to perfect his graffiti techniques over the years. After a short career as a designer, he decided to devote his life to painting at the age of twenty five.
Whether it be portraits of individuals in pop culture or great icons, Bardou always treats his subjects with passion and curiosity.
Only one step from the walls to the canvas
Vincent Bardou’s technique is just as unique as his art: he depicts characters or animals through the use of a stencil, or certain collages that can be seen on city walls, thus making art pass from the street to the canvas. He adds his ultra-coloured touch through the use of spray paint, which creates a striking contrast for the eye. His subjects then appear “glued” to the background.</td>

This Belgian artist finds his roots, his influences, in the primitive arts, African art, Oceanic art, Amerindian art, brut art but also in naive art.
Detach from academicism to create your own style
Born in 1963 in Brussels, Christian Dugardeyn (alias DUGA) is an artist belonging to the Free Expression movement. After an essential stint at the Fine Arts, he quickly freed himself from the artistic techniques taught to refocus on his instinctive emotions. He paints and sculpts viscerally, in a state of regression and on the fringes of contemporary artistic trends.
The reappropriation of his influences to give shape to his emotions
DUGA gives free rein to his emotions through different techniques: drawing, painting and sculpture. Among the contemporary artists who have permeated his work, we find among others Basquiat and Combas. From the free figuration movement, DUGA is notably inspired by Aléchinsky, Appel and the Cobra group. Without forgetting Picasso, Schiele and Expressionism as well as Dubuffet, Art Brut and Street Art. According to him, an artist cannot remain isolated in his corner, he must open up, soak up influences from the past in order to reshape them and create.
In Picasso, Basquiat and in Street Art, it is the deformations of the characters that interests him, with the preservation of a certain anatomical fidelity and gesturality. From Street Art, writings and graffiti, he particularly retains the fluidity and speed of the gesture as well as the explosion of colors.</td>

Meyv constantly studies volume in the art of sculpture and metal science. He recently succeeded in recreating the technique for gold's molecular migration in an alloy, a procedure previously used by the Incas.
Art meets craftsmanship
A passionate metalwork sculptor, Meyv expresses himself in everyday life by shaping steel, copper, bronze, silver and gold. Through an artisanal approach, he combines sculpture and metalwork to bring his imagination to life.

So we are somewhere between the energy of the gesture and the slow movement of the clouds. Drawing, installation, writing, sound proposals, each piece is an attempt to talk about the world while escaping it. Each idea opens with a challenge, the confrontation with manufacturing, the pleasure of a technical and artisanal implementation, and the desire that this manipulation disappears in a joyful and yet derisory jubilation / Jean Cristofol 2012.</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>Brought up on a diet of scrap iron, with locks around his neck, metalwork artist Jean-Marc Martinez creates a constant duality of constructionist avant-gardism and classicism in which our eyes can just make out the watermark of the forgotten pages of an ancient book. The artist’s universe is populated by often stylish but never vulgar women in hats, who appear alongside proud, cock-a-hoop men in three-piece suits.
A sensitive metalwork artist in search of harmony
Jean-Marc Martinez sculpts, welds and unwelds in the same way others go to confession. His anatomical and totemic sculptures, whose sensitivity and refreshing spirit delight the eye, are intimate illustrations of a hugely sensitive nostalgia for blossoming orange trees. Often, the composition is dense without being saturated. Sometimes wooden elements secretly reside in the metal, but there are never any sketches, never any preparatory work. The hand guides the mind and never vice versa. From it explodes a world of soothing harmony.
An ode to femininity and curves
Jean Marc “knows how to do it”, making him an iron artisan. He “dares to do it”, making him an artist worth following. Abstract or figurative, folded or twisted, his compositions enchant a disenchanted world.
But it’s no secret that man is anxious… much to our delight, behind every artist there is a woman. It’s safe to say he always recalls that everything began with a candlelit dinner and this is sealed for eternity with the imprint of a flower.</td>

In her first life, Virginie was an educator in a pediatric hospital ... When she wished to change profession, her encounters and research brought her back to the evidence of textile creation and embroidery. At that time, she only linked textiles to the world of fashion and discovered the world of hats to highlight this work of material to which she aspired. Little by little, the appropriation of techniques allowed her to divert them according to her needs and desires. To weave her own universe and to enter into sculpture... Current events, exhibitions and the opening to the recognition of textile as an Art in its own right allowed her to open herself to new possibilities... The freedom to work instinctively, to let oneself be inspired and carried by the textile, the material and/or the visual are fundamental in his practice. Her body to body with the material is a rather benevolent body to body, an exchange of good processes: sometimes the material directs her, sometimes it is Virginie who takes her... : it's a work and a time of intimacy between her and the textile. Virginie likes the idea of creating a microcosm in which one can walk and get lost; it is an invitation to a walk in the heart of the material that reflects imaginary landscapes.</td>

Geometry, by its universal and timeless beauty, occupies a central place in his work. Used as a graphic and symbolic bias, it is also an essential construction tool. In search of balance and poetry, his work challenges the "inanimate" elementary geometric figures by giving a tangible representation of hollowed, split, duplicated forms, arranged in such a way as to reveal sensitive compositions. Through the manufacture of metal, wood, wax and concrete, these forms come to life in unexpected ways, inviting the spectator to touch them. At the border between design and artwork, the artist plays with scales and questions usage. From jewellery to sculpture, the full and empty spaces interact in a harmony that is both subtle and obvious. The material, tested with respect, is sublimated down to the smallest detail.</td>

From the very beginning his work was controversial, as time went by, the aesthetics became more simplified and tended towards advertising posters. Like Gerhard Richter, the artist constantly questions his work. In 2010 he took a new direction in landscape research with photographic support. His landscapes always have that note of protest that characterizes the artist, they reveal an ideological commitment, a societal drift, sometimes underlined by the title, they are often linked to the hopes born in childhood shattered by the disillusionment of adulthood. His work is now present in many private collections in the United States (New York, Miami, Texas, Los Angeles) and Europe (France, Italy, United Kingdom, Sweden) and in a public collection, in 2004 one of his works on paper entered the collection of the "National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts" in Taipei, Taiwan.</td>

Perrine Rabouin paints her canvases in the same manner that she lives her life: by following her intuition and freely expressing her feelings. In order to give life to her work, she begins painting in the middle and moves spontaneously around the canvas, creating a constant evolution of contrasts and colours.</td>

An homage to the artist’s grandfather
Dainche discovered drawing through his work as a landscape architect, where part of his job involved drawing gardens. Gradually, his sensitivity to the stories told by the forms of living things led him to take a more personal, intuitive and artistic approach to drawing.
Loyal to the nature which had nurtured him since he was a child, Dainche chose to work under the name of his great grandfather, who had died after being hit by lightning, under a tree...
Dainche’s works are linked by their homage to the "striking" truth of trees, frequently filled with trees that seem charged with humanity, sometimes rooted, sometimes weak, fragile or robust, sometimes naked, sometimes in bloom.... He is fascinated by their silence, grace, patience, strength and elegance.
Trees: an unending source of inspiration
With Dainche, nothing is premeditated, everything is intuitive. First, there is the background, painted in watercolours, in a single session. The brush is free. The colours - blues, greys and purples – swim together, diluting one another, creating the setting and its atmosphere - snowy, heavy, crepuscular, tranquil...
The trees are then etched onto the paper, directly in Indian ink using a Rotring. There is no rough draft, no finishing touches. For Dainche, it is not so much the result that matters, nor the response, but the intention of allowing one emotion to lead to another.
For this young artist, art in its purest form is a way to reveal the essence of a form, its authenticity. On the paper, there is enough ink to start a realist movement. The audience is left to imagine their own story…</td>

Authentic collages that echo the artist's childhood
In addition to an almost emotional aspect, Erik Bonnet plays on all of society’s influence. He builds his portraits through the use/visual interpretation of pop art codes. Many come from his surroundings as a child, from science fiction, detective novels, comics, cinema and TV series. He paints using a spray-can technique typically found in street art, with collages giving way to a background made from genuine old documents.
Bonnet enjoys working with bodies. For him, this is where beauty is perceived, as well as sensuality, elegance, dreams and fantasy, sex and even stress, fear, and societal revolts against the oppressor by the oppressed. Even the "wrapping" of the works is glazed, reflecting the observer like a mirror, so that they themselves become an entity in this fictive superficiality.
Pop art in the spotlight
Immersing himself in the world of pop art, following directly on from Andy Warhol and his use of iconic figures like Marilyn Monroe, Erik Bonnet has constructed his own unique world and visual identity.
His artworks are immediately recognisable, a patchwork background of old papers, yellowed with time, and, on top, drawings that seem, like Lichtenstein’s work, to have been taken straight out of a comic – but which are in fact drawn meticulously by hand.</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>Between features and matter, a sensory journey. The point as an atom, the body of the work in gestation, the fruit of a necessary slowness ... Shape and form of memory On the ochre and earthy backgrounds of Mélanie Pasquier's canvases, enigmatic, fantastic and hybrid forms unfold. Point by point, line by line, they swarm, crawl, and take on the body that the artist patiently imprints on them. From canvas to canvas, they come to life, disturbing and strange, hesitant; here they erupt but there they fall from unsuspected heights. The bits of trees rub shoulders with bits of bodies, bones, teeth, hair, anonymous and miniature figures; feet and hands are engulfed in torrents of branches, leaves, algae, pebbles and clods of earth. But here an eye watches, a figure appears, two fingers rise and titillate a body-pocket-bag of hair from the end of which the vaporous form of the memory escapes. It is precisely from this source that Mélanie Pasquier draws her inspiration. That of the tactile memory of a hand passed through the earth or through the hair of a loved one, of a furrow traced in the ground with the tips of the fingers or of water impossible to grasp between two hands. How to translate the sensation? How to transcribe the nebulous numbness into which thought plunges when it wants to remember the materiality of the past? Mélanie Pasquier's paintings are the image of the Dream; dreamlike, floating, plasmic. They are the tables on which to expose the excavated remains of her mind and of an oxymoric memory, because they are both tactile and impalpable. Thus the forms spring up on a background that has no earthly substance other than colour. Here and there, the drips and fades, the liquid and faded colours translate the evanescence and passage, the impossible attachment of what constantly escapes. But the black contours of his drawings offer memory the material anchorage it needed to exist in the eyes of the world, to finally emerge from the "witch" who gives form to the memory filaments, and the title of the exhibition. Sensory memory is an ambiguous and fertile breeding ground. It is the belly that carries the bodies in gestation, the cavity from which they flow, by free association of motifs, before unfolding in the light and finally docking somewhere: on the artist's canvas. Point by point, line by line, the vague subterranean of memory is then gently illuminated. Rustling, impatient, it finds a second life in art. Proud to have escaped limbo and oblivion, she deploys her space in the interstice opened by the painting between life and death, the cave and its beyond, the ivory or horn doors that separate Aurelia's Nerval from the invisible world of the Dream and Mélanie Pasquier from her memories.

The framing of an image - the space of a production - offers the frozen vision of an instant, the fragmented preview of a larger whole. The format circumscribes a moment that is part of a larger movement, a continuity defined in space and time. Extending or stretching the proposal beyond a standardised framework must make it possible to understand a larger space, a temporal sequence and the perception of movement. We evolve in a changing and enveloping reality. Our perception is designed for a three-dimensional environment. Restricting one’s field of intervention in a limited format reduces our experience, encloses in the moment, freezes in the space of a framing. It is a question of extending or dilating the format, even if it means fragmenting it, even if it means that its complete perception is impossible in a single glance restricted to our visual field, or even if it means that the possibilities of exposure force fragmentation.</td>

Like markers of our time, or witnesses to our history, the formats of the compositions vary from the size of a typewriter’s paper to the large format, and it is in the scenography of the hanging of all these witnesses of a not so distant future that the climate takes on its full responsibility.

This "magical realism" inspires him to create figurative, colourful and luminous canvases in which characters are represented in a fantasized nature, surrounded by a whole friendly or threatening bestiary. The painter often places the human silhouette she masters best, her image, in order to play with our perceptions and develop a lush pictorial language. Animality is the centerpiece of a curiosity cabinet where the ancestral feelings of the psyche are expressed: fear, anger, laughter...

From her cave-workshop, where old papers, fan cardboard, pieces of wood are the kings, she draws glue guns, charcoals, varnishes, inks and brushes...

<td class='normal' valign='top'>Sasha C. Bokobza works according to reality, movement and emotion. When they are alive, her models are the people she meets whose silhouette, gait and body inspire her with a singular emotion. It is the inner movement that animates the bodies she questions through drawing and observation. The notion of snapshots is also important, often she captures her drawings in a few minutes in the subway, on a street corner, at a concert, she keeps her equipment always with her: markers filled with acrylic paints and brown paper.
The landscapes also inspire him, often urban or related to water, the sea. The emotion of a sky crossed by clouds, its reflection in a lake. Light plays a key role and Sasha C. Bokobza is committed to studying the color of the moment. Night ambiences are part of his field of investigation. Every being, landscape or object is constantly crossed by a sum of events, sometimes accidents, that transform its trajectory and form. They set themselves "in motion" in the continuity of this trajectory from their origin to the moment they meet them.
These intentionally and emotionally driven masses tell him stories that he must observe and interpret. Some of his sketches made on the motif give rise to large-format oil painting in the studio. At this point, it is a question of revisiting the memory, this time by using its own inner dimension, the oil allows this, unlike the quick sketch where Sasha C. Bokobza is more of a receiver.
His latest series, "L'homme au chapeau", is a series of portraits featuring men turning their backs more or less. The costume is important here, it is a question of studying further the area of the shoulder, neck and head highlighted by the cut of a jacket, a collar and the inclination of a hat. The hat is here the symbol of virility, transferring attributes of strength and power to these characters. The point of view places the viewer in the blind spot of these characters seen as silent cowboys.
In slight movement we don't know if they arrive or leave. From this angle we can perceive the mystery that surrounds them and that provokes both fear and attraction. It is her gaze as a woman who questions herself on this opaque patriarchal figure, without judgment, and in the observation of her own desire. The work takes place in the workshop and in two stages: a first phase of research with the model to find the angle, movement, drape, light and emotion that Sasha C. Bokobza fixes in sketches, a second phase without the model where she executes an oil in large format according to her studies.</td>

The work is wonderfully personal and theatrical and embraces a diverse range of human emotions. For Neuman, forging a consistent aesthetic link between his works is essential.

His paintings are made from photographs (or photographic combinations) of garbage cans found on the streets of the world. Real modern landscapes, they are snapshots of our lives and reveal the futility of our society. At first glance, they are realistic paintings, beautiful to contemplate - quite easy - but they actually denounce the latent problems linked to our way of life. "As a painter of reality, I want to show things that we no longer see, out of occultation or habit. The waste accumulated in the city allows me to treat all kinds of forms, materials, subjects: shiny and coloured plastics, transparency of acetates, flashy aluminiums, magazine covers dealing with current events, various packaging... I propose a similar approach to hyperrealistic painters, except that my version - through its mode of representation - differs in its meaning and purpose. My work questions both the art world - what should I paint today? - and the society of men. My garbage paintings reflect the insatiable consumerism of our society. These are modern vanities that remind us of the famous Latin phrase "memento mori", "remember that you will die". Beyond the beauty of this waste, therefore, appears a raw reality: we will all end up like soda cans, on the scrap heap! As a residual effect, I would like the viewer to find art on every street corner by recalling my work and remembering the brevity of life by meditating on the meaning of its existence..."

The artist is interested in the duality of beings, being and appearing, the image we give of ourselves and the way we look at others. She tries to show what is beyond appearances. Each of his works tells a story. She stages characters (real people but also representations of living beings such as statues, dolls, figurines) that she takes out of their initial context. She invents a story for them alongside other characters in order to establish links, connections in parallel universes that shake up the codes.

The works in this gallery are taken from the artist's recent series "Heads on Fire" and "RedRedRocks". "Heads on Fire" is based on human problems such as the climate crisis. In each drawing, Heirbaut explores the lyrical freedoms, the humour of his proteinaceous abstract creatures, which has the ability to appear in human and unfriendly form, interpreting society for better or for worse. The artist has developed his original style of undefined creatures. While some forms are more or less delimited and a little more identifiable, most are more suggestive and amorphous. Through the evocative translation of his fantasy, Heirbaut will address themes such as deception, oppression, fantasy, fear, memory and pure optimism. These drawings are quite ambiguous, leaving room for a visual transformation based on what the viewer brings to each work in terms of visual memory and referents. Geert Heirbaut, who operates on Instagram under the name Kowalsky_Days, has been invested in manipulating and combining abstract elements from scratch to create mermerizing works of art that can mean different things to viewers based on their visual memory.</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>BIOGRAPHY Born in 1954 in the North of France, from a ceramicist and musician father and a musician mother. As a child, I dreamed of doing "Fine Arts". But my parents advised me (as their own parents had done) to choose job security. So I became a psychiatric nurse, like my father, like my grandfather. At the same time I am learning to work the land with my father. In 1984, I moved to the south of France, La Provence. I regularly attend watercolour workshops, then drawing with live models, it is the revelation: "I will work on the body! "There are several courses in contemporary painting, drawing, engraving... university courses in art history and plastic arts, I attend the Beaux Arts de Toulon, participate in many exhibitions where I win many prizes. In 2010, freed from certain family constraints (my children are grown up), I decided to leave my job as a nurse to devote myself to painting. Since then, as a professional artist, I have participated in many contemporary art shows. MY APPROACH IS ESSENTIALLY PLASTIC. I am looking for a rich, constructed and powerful painting, where graphics, materials and colours ARTICULATE for a subject: the human body. An approach where semantics takes second place and comes down to: "living", without socio-political pretensions or chatter. THE SUPPORT: the canvas for me becomes "skin", body expression. The represented tends to disappear in favour of a lived body, mine, but also that of the spectator. Moreover, the format I use allows this physical engagement through gestures. GRAPHISM: everything starts and ends with drawing, working from living models. I am attentive to a gesture, a look, a shortcut, or simply a curve, a hand, a foot, a knee... In fact, an almost kinesthetic emotion guides the choice of my lines for my preparatory drawings. THE CHROMATIC ISSUE: My palette is original, daring and personal. It represents in itself a kind of signature. It is an assumed risk, because this somewhat expressionist choice contributes, I think, to the strength of my work. THE MATTER: my colours are material by asserting themselves through a certain autonomy: drips, impastoes, virgin canvas in places, creating overflow, spontaneity and the unexpected. This is probably where the "drive" dimension of my paintings is hidden. THE SUBJECT finally, the body, is an exciting subject. It cannot leave anyone indifferent because everyone can feel his or her involving strength. Naked or faces, the body always captures us.</td>

His preferred media are paper or canvas. No matter what sizes, large or small, no one can stop this incorrigible creative!
His art is at the crossroads of Street Art and calligraphy. Some of his works address contemporary societal themes that the eye in its stroll will be able to identify by the symbol.

What challenges him in his approach and role as an artist today is the search for a visual form in the mind or in abstract notions of time and space. To counterbalance these very vague notions, science takes an important part in the artist's work as he attempts to rationalize the abstract or find a visual form in the rationale of science. His focus words are patience, concentration, and rigor. He tries, however, to stay as spontaneous as possible, to repeat simple gestures, and take credit for natural human mistakes. Today, as an artist, one must face the reality of a time when the world around us is moving at an extremely fast pace while the world within us does not. He does not want to dwell on external things, events or news. These notions are the opposite of what drives him. He is attracted to what exists "between the lines", the ellipses, the moments when our eyes are closed, the internal vision of a blind man, dreams and all that that is imperceptible. Through his works, he offers the opportunity to pause and listen to our feelings, to try to visualise them and to feel them, to interact with a moment stopped in time. The discipline of practices such as drawing, painting or sculpture enables the artist to work on himself through art. The focus is not on the result, but on the mental reflection and the physical state of the creation process. Every gesture is important because it influences the next. Every thought is important because it influences the gesture. Ceramics highlight this notion much more than drawing or painting because the clay has a much more present memory of each movement that is inflicted on it. Florent's process is comparable to a machine capable of transcribing graphically or in volume, the expression of the impalpable, invisible and indescribable in us and around us...A perfect balance between art and science.</td>

I want to disturb the viewer with these "apparitions of colors" in the middle of this formalism and that we pause the question of the "why". Treat this feeling of strangeness as urban. This contrast between slowness and frenzy, this obligation to slow everything down. This urbanization that leaves us no respite. Creating my paintings in the studio is a way to avoid reality, since what is "outside" is different from my painting. The landscape allows me to contemplate from afar all the places on which I could anchor myself. Outside, I would be distracted by this reality. I can live and move in a place, I can't walk in a landscape. The place is what anchors in space, a landscape implies a displacement outside the place to better detach itself from reality. In my painting, the places are sometimes without places, and give rise to a feeling of disturbing strangeness that touches precisely on the question of home. In these landscapes, there is also a question of exile. I have a fascination for Peter Doig and his ability to talk about exile. My personal history leads me to paint these "first landscapes", these large fields. A certain nostalgia for the lost world, an aesthetic of melancholy. This contrast between two lands, two stories. It is not only landscape painting but a search for atmosphere, for questioning. In many ways, the places I choose are ordinary with a disconcerting tranquility. It's just an observation. I use photography to trigger my creative process. Photography allows assembly processes between two sometimes heterogeneous elements.

<td class='normal' valign='top'>Nathalie Si Pié’s pictorial journey began with abstraction. Her expertise is demonstrated in a personal style that echoes the pixels found on our screens.
An approach in pixels
Si Pié brings out the delicacy of her artwork using “pixelated” strokes. Through a contemporary perspective she examines visual perception: the image appears only once we take a step back.
In a very colourful dynamic, she has painted pixel portraits, and paintings entitled “Miroirs” (Mirrors). Playing with reflections, these combine the abstraction of pixels with the figuration of characters.
Exploring perception
Nathalie Si Pié is able to tackle a huge variety of themes thanks to her mastery of many very different techniques. For her series “Pixels flowers”, she revisited the traditional conception of a flower, modernising it with her own unique style.
In an altogether different process she produces large portraits entitled “The Same Other”. Assembling the faces of various individuals as one, she examines the borders of identity in vastly profound artworks.</td>

Starting from the "ink game" of the Chinese tradition, and in the experimentation of new plastic gestures and writings, she seeks to create a kind of dynamic impression, which gives rise to imaginary landscapes, probably existing somewhere in the universe, inside ourselves. Yu Zhao’s main medium is tempera, an ancestral and mythical technique of Western art. Its gradient quality is close to the wash but gives a brighter and warmer glow. Applied to watercolour paper, it allows the intensity of movements and all the colours of emotions to be recorded with nuance. In China, as in the West, landscape painting is full of clichés that divide our eyes and imagination. For Yu Zhao, the secret of creating new compositions, new images, does not lie in the limited intellectual capacity of humans. It is at the bottom of nature that contemporary man is relearning to respect and recharge his batteries. Yu Zhao lives and works in Paris. Since 2018, it has been part of the Nichido Gallery in Paris. In 2018, she published her travel diary on the road to Compostela La Voie du Sans-Sac, published by Unicité.</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>Charlotte Baston was trained very early in classical music and dance, a 10-year teaching after which she practiced professionally these two disciplines for a long time, deviating from the classical for a contemporary style. It was not until 2015 that she began painting, in a self-taught way and without any pretension or professional aim, and yet it is this art which, over the months and years, has turned out to be obvious.

Charlotte Baston has been declared a professional painter since 2019, she is now an emerging artist. "I have always needed artistic expression throughout my career, but beyond the artistic journey, it was above all a human journey, with all that that can entail. I was a dancer and musician that taught me a lot, but it is only with painting, alone and without training, that I felt able to finally express what defines me deeply. "

At the heart of the work is the Body, which presents itself as a true temple of our humanity. Bodies speak, tell us, through their poses and their treatments, Charlotte Baston makes us see men and women in her very particular way. We are far from the classic poses, but also far from a clear-cut discourse, the artist prefers to speak of whole bodies, in what they are, undoubtedly crossed but with a certain restraint, thus creating a form of tension specific to his work.

"I am not too explicit in my paintings, I do not advocate, do not affirm, I like uncertainty, in the sense that there are no certainties, I prefer reflection, delicacy. , sensitivity, I find a lot of strength and beauty in it. " In this, Charlotte Baston's work is neither black nor white, neither dark nor luminous, she likes to say that she is inspired by what is such as it is. Indeed, the artist does not like value judgments and categories, for her much too simplistic and reductive. It is precisely in the encounter between differences, inconsistencies and sometimes even opposites that his inspiration is drawn. "I believe I am a great lover of life, with all that it entails, its materials and textures, an interweaving that has always fascinated me, and I think that my painting says it much better than me ..."

Finally, Charlotte Baston's painting is an invitation to reflection rather than opinion, an approach of mind and perception, definitely at the heart of her work.</td>

Following a series of professional trips to Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing, New York, Milan, Daegu, he decided to devote himself entirely to painting with initial research in 2003.
An intimate story behind every landscape
It was at the sale of the family property that Vincent Gabin saw what he had always known escaping: dense, ubiquitous vegetation all around the house. So dense that he could no longer contemplate the Doubs, a river flowing peacefully below his garden.
As he likes to recall, “I have contemplated, maintained and absorbed this vegetation over the years.” For him, each painting in his collection could be entitled “In search of my lost garden”.
Now, his gaze is drawn to other horizons: the south, more smiling, with a different and warm light. Vincent Gabin wants us to find “our lost garden”. This is why, behind each of the paintings in his gallery, there is a very special story hidden.</td>

He grew up in a world of progressive music, surrounded by esoteric comic strips such as the Incal, by Jodorowsky and Moebius, leading him quickly to abandon a materialistic vision of the world and to develop more abstract, conceptual aspirations.
After studying illustration, comics and cartoons, he became an illustrator and comic book author himself. At the same time, he began to teach comics in various schools and for art therapy courses. He then realized how important it is for him to help others find the resources to visually represent what they need to express. His personal works, semi-abstract paintings, are part of this approach, a kind of gateway to the subconscious, each one being able to interpret forms and lines in his own way, revealing by association of ideas a new story with each reading.
It is in 2016 in Berlin that he develops, mainly with acrylic paint and aerosol cans, his pictorial technique and starts to exhibit in galleries in Berlin, London and Paris. Inspired by the exuberance and colourful abundance of Kandinsky or Albert Oehlen, Loïc Saulin is at the crossroads of currents such as lyrical abstraction, futurism, or rather his updated conception, graffuturism.
You can read in Loïc Saulin's paintings what you yourself breathe into them. The contemplation of one of his works leads each one to follow a path, a different story according to what the shapes and colours evoke.

Highlight the visible and hidden part of things, the message is often in the movement and violence of the stab wound and accentuated in a single detail of expression.

From this experience she retained solid foundations of drawing, but it is an encounter with the painting and history of the French artist Fabienne Verdier that will lead Camille to new questions, which are at the root of the work she proposes today. This contemporary painter opens a dialogue between China and France, between ancestral calligraphy and traditional Western painting. After reading Fabienne Verdier’s autobiographical book "Passagère du Silence", which retraces her apprenticeship alongside masters of Chinese calligraphy, painting has no longer become a simple medium, but a real living material, with which the painter can play.
The palette is already so rich and beautiful, it is then a question of being able to artificially reproduce what is random. The will to do something beautiful also comes from a certain weariness with speeches. The silence of the "observer" is undoubtedly the best compliment, because in addition to decorating your living room, painting has lived and will live long after all of us.
What feeds his work today: - Studies of anatomical plates, macro photography of the infinitely small, (cells) - Magic Japanese aesthetics - Painters who have made painting a material in its own right: such as, Gauguin, Francis Bacon, Alexandre Rodchenko, Jackson Pollock, Fabienne Verdier, Claire Tabouret - But also literature, because the text has a primordial importance, authors like Edmond Rostand, Albert Camus, Saint Exupéry, Charles Bukowski, Patti Smith, Yasmina Reza, to name but a few.</td>

At the same time, I am developing a series of "characters", full-length portraits with a more graphic rendering. The face always remains very worked in opposition to the body which, remaining in the form of sketches, disappears into a composition of flat areas and filaments. The universe of these portraits remains mainly influenced by the world of comics, graphics and illustration. My latest works feature semi-abstract landscapes where felt and brushstrokes interact to form a complex material. Everything is suggested, in a misty effect reminiscent of a dream. It is an intuitive painting, worked in an aesthetic search and balance above all. The goal is not to distinguish but to let oneself be carried away. In this series Man is always present but drowned in the elements, becoming an integral part of the landscape. It is only matter among matter.</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>Clara Crespin’s work wavers between narrative figuration and lyrical abstraction. Working with painting, engraving and sculpture, she creates objects and paintings that examine the body as a source of sensations and raw emotions that go beyond codes.
Art that renders the invisible visible
Clara Crespin studied contemporary art at the Ateliers des Beaux-Arts de Paris. A multidisciplinary artist, her creations reflect internal conversations. They immerse her in a world in which everything effaced by time seems to be brought back to life. They are loaded with questions about her identity and her relationship with the divine and sacred. But above all they open a door into the dimension of the metamorphosis of the invisible revealed by the artist’s hand.
Weaving a guiding theme to tell a story
The tangles and connections found in Crespin’s work are simply a pretext for evoking the concepts of uprooting and duality; these are the guiding themes. The figures that appear bring her face to face with her roots and her relationship with the world.
Womankind, respiration and myths are just some of the themes that resonate through work which is also influenced by “Primitive Art”. Over her career, the artist has found herself nearing and attaining an unexpected depth.</td>

Manuel Fernandez, alias KiKo, is a French artist born in 1985 in Martigues in this town near Marseille who inspires him with this burning orange that floods many of his works. KiKo has always had a taste for drawing and painting. He draws as he breathes. With a single assertive stroke, he sketches the emotions they do not express in words. KiKo thus builds an imaginary universe where the childhood which hangs its flight there will inspire all his work. In 2017, when he decided to devote himself to his passion for art, he symbolically chose “KiKo", his child's nickname, as his artist's name and anchored his artistic approach in these words of Jean Genet: “Create, it's always about childhood " Her artistic approach is a perpetual quest to create the ultimate emotion that will awaken the child buried in each of us. His paintings invite to preserve the candor of childhood. And if the names of big brands appear here and there on his paintings, it is to better question us about these children who will project into adulthood the melancholy of stolen childhood. Worthy heir to the artists of Pop / Street Art, it is however Amedeo Modigliani and his capacity to make feel the soul behind the model that upsets KiKo. His very personal technique and his sense of perfection complete his artistic DNA. KiKo draws in charcoal, freehand on the canvas, in the urgency of creation. Each drawing is unique, the artist refuses to use the stencil. It is with the spray and the projected paint that he realizes, with extreme caution to preserve the drawing, his sublime backgrounds in often primary colors. On the charcoal sketch, he then practices inking and repeats each charcoal stroke with a brush in India ink. If KiKo finishes his paintings with a layer of resin bringing an ultra-shine to his paintings, it is to remind us that the essential is always found under the varnish of appearance.</td>

Born in 1976 in Mulhouse, France, this self-taught sculptor has been perfecting his technique since the age of twelve, working in diverse materials. As a child, on the beach, he discovered the potential of sand; when he got older, living in the Antilles, he started working with wood. Since 2010, Zed has started an exploration of his favorite material: the acrylic glass. His sculptures may be red, they may be purple, green, yellow, or even blue - Zed explores the medium in all its chromatic possibilities.He has conceived his most famous works, the Flexos, as a natural consequence of his research on attitudes and movement. The Flexo is a unique silhouette and a neutral character. Zed believes that it is possible to translate any emotion, to say anything, simply through gestures. In its various postures, the Flexo incarnates Zed's wish to capture the variety and the fluidity of gestures: "in love, contemplative, audacious or insolent, each Flexo is a reflection of us". Each of Flexo's "cool", "daring", "active", "desperate" attitudes is obtained through thermoforming by hand. Following the same principle, Zed has developed his "Cleb'art", Roxo and Woopy, in sitting poses, all natural, sometimes caught "in the act" or waiting attentively.</td>

C215, a mysterious title might which refers to a Pantone color and a chemical formula. But behind this coded name, is an influential street artist Christian Guémy, aka C215, was born in France in 1973.In 2006, the artist began stencil work, and this activity never left his side since then. He studied history and economics, as he wanted a humanist profile of modern times, and gradually went towards History of Art. It was through this course that his passion for Caravaggio' work began. C215 yearns to transpose
splendor and beauty of classic art in our cities. In order to do this, he has taken over the walls of our cities such as Ivry-sur-Seine, and paints dreamlike and colorful works.The aspect which triggered this was heartache. He separated from his wife and couldn't see his 4 year old daughter grow up every day. He was adamant to show that he thought about his daughter everyday,
he made a stencil of his ex-wife and his daughter Nina. A creation which was key for his career as an urban artist.His daughter and basically childhood in general are among his favorite themes, and always present in his work, but C215 also tackles other universal themes. He always has a humanist perspective, he highlights those people who are left out by the society and showcases them. Unknown people turn into stencil stars. He also does light work and draws romantic couples or animals, particularly cats. C215's works are almost the size of humans, in order to be close to reality, except for certain imposing mural creations. He precisely highlights sparkling colors and lighting. One can perceive the character of his models through features and expressions which are depicted. Faces come alive and inspire poetry all over the city. According to the artist,
street art needs to be one with the environment, interact with its elements and portray true aesthetics. His first reference is Ernest Pignon, a guardian figure of urban art in France.His work goes beyond Paris and travels throughout the world, both on walls and museums. He stands out through his graphic signature, symbolizing a cube with a blaze (name or signature for a street artist) C215.</td>

Today he lives and works in Brooklyn, New York.Kaws began his career in the 1990s with street interventions. He superimposed his own work onto billboards, bus stops, and phone booth advertisements. As he became more well-known, his ads were taken down and collected by people. He created or reused well-known characters from comics and cartoons in his offbeat imagery. Subjects like the Michelin Man, the Simpsons, Mickey Mouse, Snoopy, Sponge Bob, are all common figures rooted in the collective imagination that allows the artist to adopt a universal language. Kaws's goal is to make art accessible to all. He signs all his creations with a very particular trademark: figures with crossed-out eyes, making his style easily recognizable.After becoming famous, he appropriated different techniques and extended his artistic production to the world of sculpture and painting on canvas. The passage from 2D to 3D works is motivated by his search for greater mastery of space and reality. His sculptures can reach monumental dimensions. Some of his giant characters have been exposed in front of museums, and they never fail to draw the attention of passers-by.Kaws's work is influenced by Pop Art, but also by artists such as Gerhard Richter, Claes Oldenburg, or Chuck Close.As an established artist on the international scene, Kaws blurs the line between art and product design. He works with major brands such as Nike, Vans, DC Shoes, Uniqlo. He has also established a presence in the music and film industry, collaborating with Kanye West, Burton, Pharrell Williams, and many others.Kaws has exhibited his work in some of the most famous galleries and museums around the world.

Unlike the work of his master, which is more traditional, Li lihong is inspired by the great Chinese ceramics, but with a contemporary touch.Inspired by this millenary tradition, surrounded by the greatest ceramic artists in China, Li Lihong has always dreamed of becoming a ceramic artist, as his illustrious ancestors and his teacher, master Qin Xiling, while adding a modern touch to his works.Absorbing all the influences of contemporary society, from advertising to the consumer culture (with the arrival in China of large firms such as Coca-Cola or McDonald's in the '80s ), he captures in his ceramic works the ancestral quality of porcelain and the confrontation between tradition and modernity and between the East and the West. His sculptures, most often golden or silver (and more rarely, white or colored) incorporate the blue and white aesthetic of traditional porcelain decoration. Using experimental techniques, Li Lihong achieves this surprising mix of minimalist shapes, geometrical and curved lines, and goes beyond the limits of traditional ceramics. Through elements of daily life, he expressed as well, through his visual language, the changes in the Chinese society and its capacity to assimilate various cultures to which it is faced.</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>What if in a kingdom of black humor, the king was a Cat? A king that can make fun of everything.Born in 1954 in Brussels, the artist Philippe Geluck grew up in a family surrounded by art. His father was a draftsman, his mother a soprano and as a child he began visiting museums and familiarizing with Sempé, Chaval and even with the satirical magazine, Hara-Kiri. In 1972, he joined INSAS (Institut National Supérieur des Arts du Spectacle) but a year before, young Geluck had already been noticed. He was already drawing and with his brother who was a graphic designer, they created a magazine on the walls of the toilets. A place which is more favorable for communication than we think, this way, his work was spotted by the editor of the humorous journal, "L'oeuf" who heard about Geluck and offered him a job in his magazine. From then on, he had a lot of offers and opportunities. In 1972, Geluck exhibited his work at the Palace of Fine Arts of Brussels at the event
«La Venus de Milo ou les dangers de la célébrité », his work stood besides those of Man Ray and Dali. The Maya Gallery liked the work of the artist and offered him his first personal exhibition in 1976. Philipe Geluck worked as well at the theater. He went regularly on stage and worked alternatively on the stage design and acting. During an audition for a friend, he finally got the main role and played in the National Theater for the first time. At the age of 26, Geluck had already a pretty hectic life, but in 1980 he took a decisive turn. His marriage to Dany was announced and the cartoonist had the idea of using a funny cat and his wife on the wedding announcement cards, to symbolize the young couple. The idea was a success, and in 1983 Luc Honorez,
journalist for «Le Soir » asked Geluck to make drawings of their new face. The Cat was born, long live the Cat. He quickly became the mascot of the magazine and much more. The Cat appeared as well in the magazine « A Suivre », before they offered him his very own edition. In 1986, the first comic strip which was completely devoted to the Cat come out. This was a major hit and Belgium found in him its modern icon. Phillipe Geluck did not given up stage acting, in fact he began acting for the cinema in 1990, where he worked with Laurent Ruquier on " On n'est pas couché" as well as with Michel Drucker. Ten years later, the feline won the heart of many with « Le Chat s'Expose » which was the first exhibition completely dedicated to him, at the Fine Arts of Paris, which opened its doors to comics for this occasion. Finally, we can see the importance of satirical artists of the caliber of Philippe Geluck, who reached freedom of speech and spread humor through his drawings.</td>

Thoma Vuille is a Franco-Swiss painter, born in Boudry in the canton of Neuchâtel in 1972. He is the creator of the M. CHAT graphic series, a grinning cat soaring over the roofs of Paris. Thoma Vuille started painting in the streets with acrylic at the age of 15, in memory of his grandfather, who was a house painter. Vuille studied at the Institute of visual Arts of Orléans from 1995 to 2001, but quickly discovered his preference for street art. The idea of M. CHAT came to him in 1997 after a little girl drew a cat during a workshop in a school in Orléans. Thoma Vuille adopted this idea and created his very own M. CHAT, who started by wandering the streets of Orléans before moving to Paris.Today, the artist and this animal have become an indivisible whole. Who is M. CHAT? The artist or the character? Or is it both? Whether he is alone or not, with or without wings, M. CHAT can no longer be reduced to a simple logo.With his simple and clear lines, M. CHAT has become an urban symbol bringing joy and optimism to the city. His fame has allowed for variations, changing color and posture but keeping his strong identity. His need for wings is explained by the inaccessible places in which he is represented. This cat reminds us of another character, Lewis Carroll's "grinning cat", the Cheshire Cat, whose smile never fades. A smile full of infectious enthusiasm, just like Thoma Vuille's art.</td>

Having freedom of expression and not being limited to one style or technique of making art are paramount to my identity as an artist. I love the many different processes of making art and experimenting with new ways of creating art. My inspiration stems from color, music, literature, and the excitement about the unknown possibilities of taking everyday objects and using them in a way that differs from what the manufacturer intended. I use a combination of found objects, acrylic paints, and aerosol paints to create abstract patterns on wood and canvas. Some of my methods include combining different chemicals and paint on paper or in plastic or wood box frames to distort vivid colors that are mixed or thrown right on the canvas.

He travelled to Morocco and then to Egypt to study Arabic calligraphy from the greatest masters and teachers. At his return to Paris, he transposed the ancient Arab techniques into
contemporary mediums such as scotch tape and spray paint for his paintings and posters. He creates a unique and universal signature inspired by the labyrinth, a recurring motif in his work.These compasses and labyrinths made of gaffer tape (white scotch tape used on film sets) and applied on the ground are an invitation to reflection. In each of these works, one can always guess a word, more or less hidden, which is one of the inherent characteristics of the urban art to which he is associated. His artworks have been shown in many museums and institutions such as the George Pompidou Center, the Palais de Tokyo or the Grand Palais.</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>William Sweetlove was born in 1949 in Ostende, Belgium. Since 2003 he has been a member of the artists’ collective “The Cracking Art Group” in northern Italy. 

As the physical medium that provides the basis for their works of art, the members use a type of plastic produced via a thermo-chemical reaction in crude oil. This reaction, known as “cracking” is also the origin of the group’s name. In their manifesto the Cracking Art Group call upon their members to spread a vision of the world suffused with elements of irony and ecological awareness. 

To those, William Sweetlove adds the conviction that art must also be an antidote to overconsumption and overproduction. His paintings, sculptures and assemblages are his impressions of existence reproduced in materials such as polyester, animal hides and textiles. William Sweetlove shapes his own world.</td>

Born in 1988 in Epinal, Levalet grew up in Guadeloupe and returned to Paris at the age of 17. He started to paint at the age of 13, but only began studying Art at the Beaux-Arts in Strasbourg after his return. Although he is equally passionate about theater, the audio-visual sector,photography, sculpting and painting, he finally decided to specialize and focus on visual Arts.Using ink on Kraft paper, Levalet developed a series of characters, based on photographs or self-portraits, that are displayed on the walls of Paris. Inspired by cinema, improvisation and mimes, Levalet uses codes and references from live entertainment to create a fictional troupe of life-size comedians interacting with bystanders. In a desire to promote urban art, the 13th district has allowed Levalet to continuously unleash his creativity by providing him with space for his work. Glued on the walls, Levalet's characters easily lure us into their absurd adventures in which they gently mock, while simultaneously brightening, our everyday lives.

Influenced by his carpenter father, Ferreira started out in building design and began his career as a surveyor.However drawing and designing quickly became more important to him than the buildings and he soon threw himself into painting. His love for geometric art and maths has come to define his style. You can find the influence everywhere; complex equations, shapes and puzzles are spread across his artwork. Out of this mathematical mayhem comes Toto, Ferreira's seminal protagonist, who looks like he's walked straight out of a child's drawing.He does takes inspiration from science and rules however his art is completely instinctive and spontaneous. You can feel his passion oozing from his artwork.The paint spills across the edges of his artwork, showing it off in three dimensions and giving the impression that the canvas was there long before the wall. Even with more detailed work involving the use of perspective, like his pieces based on the famous Rubik's cube, popular in the 80's, the artist still does a sketch or lines in his distinctive style.The materials used, ranging from material to metal, are undoubtedly as significant as the colours and geometric shapes they create. A paintbrush is thrown aside for a trowel, a knife or even the artist's own fingers. Constantly darting back and forth in front of the canvas, he also appreciates stepping back and admiring it from afar - which is why you're more likely to find him in front of a big canvas than small.When covered with a glossy topcoat, the canvases show off all their colours and movements. They sparkle and change throughout the day. If his artwork and personal story remind you of Basquiat, you'll be pleased to hear that Basquiat was a big inspiration for Ferreira and references to the artist can be found throughout his work.We recognise Ferreira works not just by the signature, but by his favourite number, 15. This figure carries a huge significance for both the artist and his family, a reminder of happy times gone-by, and it follows him across every one of his pieces.</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>Caroline Brisset is an artist born in 1988 who lives and works in Liège.

She works with metal in all its forms through sculpture, installations and performance, working as a craftsman, artist and designer. According to her "The state is irrelevant when talking about the subject" Her work is a dialogue between the capacities of the materials and the object that she creates, which have a unique identity, sometimes organic or alive.

Caroline Brisset explores the physical limits and possibilities of metal by heating, melting and twisting it, trying to make it express by itself. Through her pieces, the artist seeks to reach a level where the appearance of the material is inconsistent with its constitution.

Her sculptures have been exposed, between others at the Gallery Acabas in Paris and at the Art Thema Gallery in Brussels.</td>

He studied architecture and design, but he kept his passion for the arts, especially for painting throughout his career.The influence of pop art and street art is visible in his work, which is declined on various media: he paints on canvas, often producing large-format, imposing works, but also on less conventional media. He creates hybrid and surprising works, at the same time paintings and sculptures, on oil barrels or on mailboxes. On these barrels of oil, symbol of globalization, he paints logos of luxury brands, symbols of desire; the tension that the artist creates by this overlay creates works with an impressive presence and materiality. He also makes small-format sculptures, such as his "teddy" limited edition, sold out in just a few days after their launch.The defining element for his work is Light, the light that caresses the characters' bodies, highlights the shape of a face or of an object. The delicacy of Marc Boffin's gradients, the finesse of the details, the formal purity of his works allow them to be part of any interior, from baroque to contemporary...This aspect is one that interests him, as he uses his interior designer knowledge to enchant the eye of the viewer. Marc Boffin is listed in the Larousse dictionary and also works one commission, creating exclusive paintings: portraits, landscapes, still lives, vanities). There is no limit to his creativity.</td>

In 1995, Hiro Ando began a career as an illustrator after graduating from the university of Tama Art in Tokyo. In 2005, he founded an artists' studio in Tokyo with another artist, Saori Nakamishi to manage the creation and promotion of other young neo-pop artists who include their own popular culture in their creations. Today around 10 artists are part of this studio "Crazynoodles". Hiro Ando is a polyvalent artist. He has used oil on canvas, digital supports and worked in video art. Hiro's technique consists in elaborating several basic sketches before painting on the canvas. The last take shapes and emerges from the streets of Tokyo by night, they are clad with colors and graphics and move in groups. Hiro paints dark urban landscapes with red fish scattered in the canvas. The mix of the two topics makes the whole canvas both dynamic and violent, with an odd feeling of eternity due to the red fish which are reminiscent of ancient Japanese paintings and watercolors. Just recently Ando added sculpture to his large spread of media and started working on a series of green or orange sculptures which were inspired by his Japanese popular culture. In this way, the cat, which in Japan is a lucky charm in the form of the Maneki-Neko, comes in a variety of traditionnal Japanese figures such as the Samurai or the Sumo. He translates this theme in a very modern way. The shiny and smooth materials, the bright colors, the sharp but rounded shapes of Hiro Ando's sculptures take us to the world of Mangas in which the artist's generation grew up in. The art of Hiro ANDO is the meeting between the Meiji era and the Manga , it is Shogun in Pokemon land , it is traditionnal Japan viewed through young eyes : it definitely is Japanese Neo Pop Art.</td>

His sense of detail, the intensity of his drawing and the light and shadow effects are some of the elements that make his unrivalled talent. We can easily feel emotions like love, joy, fear or regret even if sometimes it's difficult to grasp separatly all those emotions, because they are all mixed together. The artist's wish is to elaborate a face which express those feelings. To do it, some artists used music notes and others prefer danses' moves. Yoanns' way is brush strokes."Solitudes or dialogues Dreams stopped Fighting or motions Speed or silence"For Yoann, being an artist means searching for human comprehension. He doesn't want to impose an accurate perception of his work to his public. He just want to share it. "Being" and "feeling" are at the heart of his painting, without artifice.</td>

As a child he was inspired by this artistic energy, and used to draw imaginary worlds on paper or other media on which he could put his hands.As an adult, he met the artist Henri Baviera who taught him printmaking techniques. His work was warmly received as he had his first shows. René Galassi's precision and patience with this rigorous engraving work lead to the exceptional quality of his prints. His work is characterized by the intensity and depth of his blacks, which contrast the luminosity of his compositions.An artist of many great talents, he creates intriguing drawings, silhouettes and collages of great finesse in just a few traits of the pen. He continues to work with the same rigour, creating black and gold paintings, made with lively and mysterious materials.Totems of all sizes come to life in a new painting work, bursting of colours, an ode to the Mediterranean sea. Recently, his artistic path took him to other shores where color is predominant and he can work with less conventional materials.However, his favourite material is the paper of the engravings that opened to him the doors to the world of creation... Sensitive to this support, he gives life, on paper, to the meanders and contortions of the nature that he loves to contemplate, always surprising, unique, beautiful, on which humans left their marks, their traces.He translates his feelings by translating in his works nature's twirls, as beautiful as the vines of fragrant wisteria... Admiring the curves of René Galassi's "Calicots", we can imagine being rocked by the Mediterranean as the Mistral starts to blow, or venturing onto the hiking trails that criss-cross the Alps rising above the sea. Or maybe flying over a field and following the furrows that farmers make as they work the land in spring...</td>

He joined the Paris College of Art, an American school of art and design formerly known as the renowned Parsons Paris.Borger's style is closely related to the neo-expressionist movement of which Jean-Michel Basquiat is the most renowned representative ; Basquiat is also the biggest influence on Noah Borgers's work, mainly visible in the primitive figures he draws. The French artist likes to mix mediums and materials; he uses acrylic and pastel that combine and create seemingly childish scenes, both surreal and poetic.He also uses digital tools in his work. Borger sometimes uses photographs of his own abstract paintings as a starting point and uses many effects and tricks to achieve the result is looking for. The combination and assemblage of materials gives surprising results that draw the viewers into his universe. He says of his work: "I don't really have a technique, I just go at it, with all sorts of mediums, adding and erasing."Borger's body of work appears as unique as his technique, his subjects can be very eclectic, ranging from pop culture references such as "Mama I missed the plane" to Greek myths and to nudes.Noah Borger's rise on the international art scene is a certainty.

At the age of 14, he tried sculpture and discovered this technique. He comes from a family of artisans, he left high school quickly, and devoted himself to carving stone. But it was through two encounters that his technique and life, took up a whole new meaning. Marc petit came across two sculptors from Beaux-Arts Paris, and they became his mentors. René Fournier and Jean Lorquin. Both of them will give him a sharp eye and thoughts on sculpture. René Fournier took him towards the art of modeling and provided him with the teachings of Marcel Gimond, a legendary sculptor of the 20th century, known for his creations of busts of political figures or the artistic scene. Jean Lorquin had himself won the Prix de Rome in 1949 and was resident at the Villa Medicis, he provided Petit with a know-how on sculpture and mainly a deep reflexion. With bronze, terra cotta and plaster, Marc Petit created his first sculptures of human beings. Lonely characters with a gloomy look. They seemed lost, and were dominated by oppressiveness or spite. The body has a tired, disembodied look. One doesn't know if it's a tragedy or a floating moment, like a soul wandering in a limbo. When we are in front of these figures, we put a distance but a voyeuristic one, more confused rather than empathetic. Marc Petit realized his first personal exhibition at the age of 24 and slowly made his name among galleries and collectors.</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>Movement: Minimalist Sculptors 

After his studies in graphic design in Bordeaux, Nicolas Dubreuille moved to Dublin, in 1999 at the age of 23: then worked as a graphic designer for a Whisky company. As a self-made artist, he spent more and more time drawing and he discovered, during a several months trip to Asia and Oceania, the use of clay in New Caledonia. Back to Europe in 2002, he moved to Milan and decided to fully dedicate himself to ceramic. He had his first solo exhibition at the Cultural Area Frida. A new trip to Asia helped him deepen and personalize his work. Living close to Bordeaux since 2004, he has produced, in the first place, ceramics, associating a shape with a drawing. Searching for more freedom in the way to express himself, he has slowly started giving up clay to prioritize a new material: resin. It allows him to shape his drawings the way he really wants."Je marche sur la tête" (Walking on my head) is the title of a sculpture in coloured resin by Nico which speaks for itself. Having first studied graphic design, Nico turned his attention to sculpture in the year 2000 and has since developed his own personal style, both playful and unconventional, but nevertheless part of art history. His lacquer-coated resin sculptures or acrylic drawings on rice paper bring to mind celebrated contemporary artists such as Arp, Brancusi, Calder, Etienne-Martin, Moore, Smith, etc. They are also reminiscent of Bertrand Lavier's Walt Disney Productions or could relate to minimalism, pop art and free figuration. Nico's inventiveness, his way of opening doors between these different paths, between abstraction and figuration, concept and expression, stands for creative and outstanding art. Matrix, geometric, biomorphic and totemic forms all encased within each other, the sculptures are reminiscent of individuals, animals, habitats and architectures. The sculptural elements consist of modules or solid and curved forms with smooth surfaces. They are brought to light with monochrome and vivid, luminous colours: yellows, reds, blues, greens… These artificial, industrial colours, similar to those of sugared sweets, appear as synthetic as the resin Nico uses to build the structures and as the objects mass-produced by our consumer society which are similar to these unique sculptures.Nearly always pierced with holes, holes/eyes (we walk on our head but we look, see, and can be seen), holes/sexual (we are reminded of the symbolism of rings), elevations or rounded forms, the sculptures are reminiscent of untold stories (most of the time they don't have a title). With Nico's sculptures, you have to go beyond the evenness of his three-dimensional art, look through the other side and try to walk on your head.</td>

He then moved to the south of France at the age of 25, and fell under the spell of Saint-Tropez. Self-taught and multidisciplinary artist, Paul Richard Mason is a painter, accomplished musician, published poet, but also a wood and terracotta sculptor. “The expressions of man" is the first series of paintings that the artist realizes, which very early on won him the attention of a large New York gallery, thanks to which he carried out a one-year residency. From there, exhibitions followed one another in Europe (France, Italy, Luxembourg, Monaco, London) and the United States (New York, Boston). His rapid success led him to open his own studio-gallery in Cogolin in 2008, then a second in 2010, in the center of Saint-Tropez. From his black and white canvases to those bursting with color, from the minimalist line to the profusion of patterns and shapes, Paul Richard Mason likes to vary the techniques while always keeping the same intensity of the gesture that characterizes him. He works mainly from his memory and his imagination and refuses the reference to an exclusive model. On the contrary, he draws on a large number of fragments of images that he has gleaned here and there and which have struck his sensibility. His works are figurative, but not realistic, which allows the artist to express emotions in their purest form. They denote a strong influence of the cubism of Picasso and Braque, a colorful style with references to the primitive arts. Lately, Paul Richard Mason deals with the theme of feminine sensuality in more colorful works and adopts a style that tends towards design and architecture. Paul Richard Mason recently exhibited at the Twentytwo Gallery (Lyon), at the contemporary art fair Art Monaco, at the Galerie Giacobetti (New York), at the Hotel Villa Belrose (Saint-Tropez), during the Salon art shopping (Paris) or even at the Château des Launes.</td>

He lives and works in Paris.After studying at the Ecole Supérieure des Arts Modernes in Paris, he became an illustrator and graphic designer for literary and phonographic editions until 1991, when he decided to dedicate himself exclusively to painting. He took part in numerous solo or collective exhibitions, both in France and abroad.Philippe Huart seeks to neutralize the effect that advertising, marketing and consumption have on our unconscious. His painting is based on the objective reality that there is nothing other than what we see. The pictorial perception has nothing to do with the objects at first, but with forms and rhythms. "It is what motivates me when I frame the closest possible my images reduced to fragments." The pictorial work is precise enough and explicit in a world where the image has become an essential vector for communication. These images are the ones that trigger Philippe Huart?s expression process.The artist does not address the elements of daily life, he addresses its signs. These signs are accumulated in our environment, whether they are domestic or public, to the point of no longer being perceived. Their accumulation and their frequency make them common, but the juxtaposition and mix of their enlarged fragments show them to us as if they were new to us, although familiar.Through painting and sculpture practice and the choice of his subjects, Philippe Huart shows us the relationship that we have with objects that we populate our universe with. His painting is not that of an artist who would take a neutral position; it expresses the thoughts of the author on our world and its culture, which are common in our daily lives.</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>In his sculptures, David Moreno builds imaginary architectures. To contemplate his pieces is to get lost in them. To the aesthetic experience must be added the reflective one. Moreno's architectures tell us about human relationships: the bonds we establish, the interconnections, the flows of energy, love or power between people. Moreno sees our links, affiliations and phobias with those thin lines that unite us to others or to ourselves. But that is just my interpretation, each one will find its own significance for those piano strings, flexible but strong, interconnecting the elements together. His work is meticulous: every line welded with a silver thread point. Dot by dot, just how human bonds are built. Although mine is not a capricious interpretation, as the titles of his pieces guide us in this sense: Between one and another, We go from one to another, Together or From small one to the big one, to mention just a few examples.David Moreno explores new territories. On the one hand, experimentation with color to add another dimension to his sculpture. On the other hand, he goes a little further in the construction of imaginary spaces. In one of his new series, Connection of cathedral, the house disappears and in its place appears the stairs and the Romanic porticos. Flexible ties are replaced by rigid steps. The relationship is another one. The descents and ascents can have multiple interpretations: from the mystical experience to the structures of power.It could be said that its spaces, those small houses drawn in the air with piano strings and steel rods, are spaces that represent us, with which we can identify ourselves. We are inside the house and we are the house, at the same time: the inhabited becomes inhabitant.</td>

Since nearly 30 years, Charles Fazzino enchants us with his 3-dimensional representation of a coloured, playful and glittering world. This New York artist, creator of the 3D Pop Art, initially threw an amused glance on his city, painting with many details and in a very recognizable style, his districts, inhabitants, taxis and frantic life… With the passing years, he turned to other American, European or Japanese cities. 

Sports, the cinema, medicine, are among his favourite themes. After several sketches, his 3D works derives from an original painting from where silk screen prints will be made, then hand-cut and glued in layers.

Charles Fazzino is often referred to as a pop culture historian because of the breadth of his work and the way it touches his collectors and captures the best parts of their contemporary lives. His legacy will mark him as part of the next generation of famous pop art artists as he follows the paths originally forged by pop art pioneers like Andy Warhol, Keith Haring, Red Grooms, and Robert Rauschenberg.

From his sculpture teacher taught he learned to appreciate noble materials and to treat them with the greatest respect. Showig great promise, the young Pablo obtained a scholarship in Italy where he specialized in marble sculpture. He finally settled permanently in Europe, in France. Contrary to mainstream, serious design, Pablo Reinoso creates objects of great quality but always fun and whimsical. He often uses incongruous materials and shapes that push the limits of what is possible to make. He puts into question fabrication processes and challenges material constraints. His career took a decisive turn in 2002 after he exhibited his installation "Ashes to Ashes" at the Casa de Américas in Madrid. Having reached maturity in his practice, in this piece he explores the ideas of society and political power.In 2009, he launched the "Scribbing Benchs". Throughout the 2000s, Reinoso produced poetic works by revisiting ordinary benches and industrial chairs. With the "Scribbing Benchs" series, he went into new territories. He began his creative process with the material, in this case a very heavy steel beam, which he managed to twist in order to make public benches.  In addition to sculpture, Pablo Reinoso is an established artist who produces modern paintings and draws day and night. In all his works, whatever their medium or the pictorial technique, we always find his sensitivity for beautiful things and his unique mastery of the craft.Discover other emerging talents such as Susumu Shingu, Jean-Paul Carbonel, or Alexandre Mussard...</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>Piotre</td>
<td class='normal' valign='top'>1987</td>
<td class='normal' valign='top'>France</td>
<td class='normal' valign='top'>At just thirty years old, Pierre Ygouf, better known under the pseudonym “Piotre", is part of this new generation of graffiti artists whose side continues to climb.
Born in Caen in…, this young visual artist has always been precocious. If many artists swear to have always been passionate about art, in the case of Piotre, the formula seems adapted. Indeed, in kindergarten already, the Caennais affirms that when he grows up, he will be a painter or draftsman and he asks for books on Picasso. A little later, he joined the high school of applied arts, La Ruche and graduated from Strate College, an art and design school in Paris. This jack-of-all-trades accumulates influences and does not hesitate to mix styles. He thus succeeds in the tour de force of perfectly combining pop-art and street-art.
Piotre's work is largely influenced and more or less explicitly by the masters of the late twentieth century: Andy Warhol, Jean-Michel Basquiat or Keith Haring to name a few.
An adjective that frequently emerges when speaking of French remains “hyperactive". Piotre needs to take on new challenges, to challenge the media and the techniques used. He thus easily passes from the canvas in the workshop to the fresco in the street. Piotre has also collaborated with big brands in search of a younger and fun image like the watchmaker Louis Pion. The graffiti artist is also called upon by cities to carry out large-scale projects (Lyon, Lisbon, Marrakech, Miami…).
The recipe for this dazzling success can be summed up in its unique style, recognizable at first glance.
Piotre makes it a point of honor to rehabilitate the work of personalities that he considers to be under-rated; he then integrates them into his over-vitaminized paintings. The graffiti artist favors a palette of primary colors that he then mixes with black and white to create stronger contrasts.
Finally, we cannot deny the importance of the world of American advertising of the fifties, as well as comics on the work of Piotre.</td>

He is one of those artists who can never be confined within a spatial or temporal category of art history, or studied in terms of comparisons with, or references to, artists of the past. Meggiato has no fear of responsibility or challenges; he has always shown attention and respect for the Renaissance arts and, perhaps partly because of this, has maintained an expressive code that is independent and recognisable over time, yet always changing. 

Gianfranco Meggiato leaves nothing to chance while establishing nothing in advance in studies or preparatory drawings. Everything that looks ‘within reach of the eye’ morphs into an enigma to be solved while what appears contorted, cryptic and impenetrable breaks down magically before our eyes, provided we surrender to his work, temporarily becoming an active, integral part of it.

He is of Portuguese origin, his parents fled the regime of Salazar, the dictator and emigrated to Sweden during early 70s. At the age of 10, he moved to Paris with his family. He discovered graffiti and in 1989, which is when he invented his famous character, called Mr A.

He worked in an unbridled pace, around 20 tags per night. He drew over 300 000 Mr. A's on all mediums at the beginning of his career. He devoted many years to graffiti, without actually being acknowledged, his character Mr. A suddenly became successful. The public was taken in by this easy-going bulbous face, often with a top hat, along with one round eye and the other crossed, as if he was winking to the viewer. Standing on long slender straight legs, Mr. A looked a lot like his inventor: cheerful, charming and malicious.

After having opened his gallery in Paris « La mercerie d'André », where he sells his work, he was discovered in 1998 by Japanese sponsor, who launched his career on the artistic scene in Tokyo. In 2002, he opened the concept store called BlackBlock at Palais de Tokyo. In 2004, André created frescoes at the new airport terminal in Tokyo. It appeared in 2010 in Banksy's movie called "Faites le mur!'

André Saraiva became famous worldwide for his work as an artist but was also dispraised by some as a "vandal" and even more so by environmental activists who defended the Joshua Tree National Park in California where André created a graffiti on a rock, in the parking lot of the park. In 2011, his works were exhibited at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, at Grand Palais in Paris and during the 54th Venice Biennial. In 2014, not to mention a retrospective which was organized at the Museu do Design e da Moda in Lisbon</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>Brice Gelot is a self-taught contemporary French artist, born in 1985 in Dijon. His creative passion began with street photography, skateboarding and graffiti culture. Over the years, he has broadened his artistic horizons to include painting and sculpture. Gelot has dedicated his life to creating artworks which express his message all over the world, moving to Australia and later to London.Over the years and throughout his travels, Gelot gradually moved away from photography and decided to create his own movement. He draws his inspiration from the Latin expression 'Memento mori': 'an artistic style where all creation is produced with the objective of reminding humans of their own mortality'. To that end, the artist is concerned by ever-increasing crime rates, particularly in London. He aims to denounce this violence through his works, which he achieves by placing the importance of life at the heart of his compositions. His work combines painting and sculpture, interwoven with calligraphic lettering, to explore the dark side of life. With that aim in mind, he expertly uses black paint in his work. He likes to remind us of our own mortality, our mistakes and failures, the inevitable passage from life to death but above all, the importance of life and the need to cherish it.His slogan 'Make art, stop war' is a pacifist message, full of hope for the future, 'Life is short and it is up to us to make it beautiful'.He exhibits in Los Angeles, Paris and London.</td>

He combines traditional sculptural knowledge and technical skills with contemporary issues and thereby manages to create sculptures of great intensity and appeal. His work does polarize. There is a strong contrast between the aesthetic beauty of his sculptures and the content of the issues, where a profound confrontation with the vagaries of human existence takes place.On the one hand Mario Dilitz manifests the contradictions occuring in human nature, on the other hand he manages to unite them in his work. Even his choice of material reveals these contradictions. His sculptures, most of them lifesized, are created out of high quality laminated wood. After a process of destruction and then construction the wood has reached a new form of stability, which wouldn't have been possible in its natural condition. This process is made visible by the joints of glue in the laminated wood. Mario Dilitz chooses red glue thereby signing his creations unmistakably.Dilitz now works and lives in Axams nearby Innsbruck and Munich.</td>

The lost-wax casting technique is to him the nicest approach to making a sculpture, as every sculptor's dream is to finalize his work in bronze. He goes on sculpting, designing furniture as well as jewelry, and in 1995, he releases his first hand crafted fountain pen "stylo sculpture".
 
In 2005, he creates his first "passage", a figurative cut-out see-through metal plate, highlighting the invisible "the transparency of the statuary".

A precocious lover of drawing and literature, he went on to study architecture at the Ibero-American University. Going against the grain of the great principles of architecture, he found in the person of Mathias Goeritz, his teacher, an excellent mentor. In 1960, he met Los Hartos, a Dadaist group who, like him, rejected political and social art. He then freed himself a little more from aesthetic diktats and created his own architectural principles, in opposition to those taught at the university, which he found far too functional. Very detailed, his psychedelic work abounds in references to several religions (he even invented a new one), to Aztec codes and to tantric writings.

Shen Jingdong also uses these communists icons in his paintings and sculptures, but he does this a particular way. He paints the soldiers and the world that he got to know during the sixteen years he spent in the army.

Shen Jingdong presents his soldiers in the most brilliant light in the "Eight Route Army", having in mind the iconic images of Mao Zedong, the Japanese comics, the terracotta warriors and the children soldiers.

For him, they are not mere killing machines, but rather consumer objects, toys coming straight out of a hypermarket or an assembly line.

Ryder studied at Goldsmiths, University of London; Winchester School of Art; Leicester School of Art and Hammersmith College of Art, London. His multidisciplinary practice is concerned with visual experience and colour perception, extending across painting, light and kinetic sculpture. His approach is influenced by developments in art making in the 1960s, particularly the ZERO group formed in Dusseldorf in 1957 and the Paris-based Groupe de Recherche d'Art Visuel (GRAV), artists who explored the use of light and motion to open up new forms of perception. Profound experiments that use the seduction of light, colour and movement to extend visual perception beyond a viewer's previous experiences, Ryder's practice shares analogues conceptual terrain with the work of Otto Piene, Heinz Maacke, Francois Morellet, Julio Le Parc, Carlos Cruz-Diez and Jesus Raphael Soto, artists for whom physical and perceptual phenomena are key.Investigating the physical or perceptual relationships between differing elements, Ryder's work often references the body or the natural world, incorporating heat dissipating devices, insulated electrical circuits, or the physical expression of balance and weight. His early work was kinetic, beginning with an interest in the movement of the sun, air and reflected colour. Later he experimented with miniature electric motors, LED lights, solid-state electronics, programmable microcontrollers and individually magnetised semi-mobile elements which were incorporated into suspended kinetic arrays. More recent work is concerned with space and depth differentiation and twilight colour perception, specifically an exploration of the Purkinje Shift, a colour perception anomaly that occurs at dusk. These new large-scale wall-mounted works integrate depth and space with differential illumination using three-dimensional LED light arrays that project large visual events onto the surrounding supporting walls. Reduced to essential form and function, Ryder's work communicates directly and intuitively with the viewer, often invoking the seasons; from the amber tones of Autumn to the crips blues of Winter, the fresh notes of Spring or the warm chromatics of high Summer. Ryder describes these objects as conceptual muscles. Almost machine-like, each piece is a nexus of constrained phenomena anchored by colour, light and movement.</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>Tilt is a French artist, born in Toulouse in 1973. His background is in street art and he has been involved in graffiti for more than 25 years. He discovered this style of art as a teenager in his home town. It was a revelation: his new passion led him to leave Toulouse for the train lines of the Bronx in New York, in search of the perfect wall. Tilt describes himself as a graffiti artist.


Tilt’s mastery of graffiti techniques has propelled him to stardom on the international stage. Beyond graffiti’s aesthetic nature, it has the ability to give meaning to an object, to divert its primary function to give it a new status. Through this art, Tilt appropriates a number of abandoned objects, breathing new life into them. As part of this, he uses bubble letters, the famous letters with recognisable curves which are found across the artist’s work.
Changing an object’s status: that’s what Tilt’s art is all about, along with a political message. The artist uses plenty of objects of destruction as part of his work, transforming them into inoffensive items through the use of colours and lettering.</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>Cesare Callegari, born 1974, graduate in Art and Communication. It’s from communication that all his work about art starts from. He’s always interested in creating social objects. Art as a way to describe his life and the lives of the people around him, taken by the places where he lives and has lived. He uses a mix of tecniques, focused mostly on 3D objects where he works on different scales. He uses plaster of different texutures, artificial self made resins, different kind of metal wires and nails, paper, varnish and acrilic paints. 

Cesare Callegari tends to test one by one each material and to combine different mixtures of the same material in order to obtain the best results for each of them. That’s because every single material has to run around and fit perfectly the concept for which the object is created. 

He’s fascinated by the psychological acts of the people. About the cause-and-effect by which things happen in the everyday life. About the reasons of general or specific behaviour. And he tries to translate these feelings in the objects he produces. 

Cesare Callegari's work is deeply inspired by the music, especially the punk, dark and the new wave culture of the 80’s and can be considered always in a goth view, but read under his will to be playful. His main focus is to create objects that can be easily read by people as reflection of their own reality. That’s why he’s always in his own personal challenge in finding more usable and smartest way to express in sculpting, painting and even in poetry: he has published his first collection of poetry in 2009 and he is finishing the second book.</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>Inspired by the counterculture of the 90s, Zokatos naturally turned to street as his original ground of expression. He kept the brutality of graffiti, its suggestive strength and a very particular idea of painting. From the wall to the canvas, his work evolved, but he kept using Street Art techniques, mainly markers and the spray paint. His abstract and colorful compositions are in contrast with the grey universe of the Parisian bloc buildings where he grew up. His artwork, already rich and varied for a 29-year-old artist, is an original synthesis mixing street and abstract art, switching easily from spray paint, watercolor or paint to sculpture.The softness of his non figurative aesthetics made of forms and lively colors is in contrast with the spontaneity of his artistic gestures. We think then of an allegory of the dilemma of the urban artist with this constant tension between the street and the gallery space, and the canvas, a necessary tool, although often rejected by street artists.If we search for his sources of inspiration, we might think of the artists of the New York School, from Pollock's action painting to Sam Francis's post-painterly abstraction. He is also influenced by lyrical abstraction and artists such as Mathieu, Schneider or Hartung. Zokatos is an artist whose existence is conditioned by the artistic act of painting and for whom the canvas, the vital medium of expression, is an end in itself.</td>

His work is at the intersection of geometric abstraction, constructed art and digital art. This work is related to mathematics, more particularly to geometry, to series, to progressions, to randomness.
He made many paintings, sculptures and drawings.
Some paintings juxtapose multiple surface elements, nested in structures, or arranged randomly, which allows rhythmic color variations according to the construction of the object.
The drawings are made in colored pencil and consist of the superposition or crossing of different screens. The experiment consists in varying the different parameters of the frame.
Several people have testified to his work;
"Her relief paintings are like so many vitaminized music" (Maryline Lefebvre)
“An art carried by a mathematical dynamism. "
“Jean-Paul defines his art as a game between randomness and constantly redefined rules from which ideas emerge, which will give rise to new paintings, sculptures and drawings. Each work contains the germ of another, thus forming an associative chain. »(Federico Maldonado January 2018)

manifesto, composed of denials, stating the conditions, which we impose ourselves in order to arrive to make something that would be new enough and would become a creation one day. (...) Thus, I made mountains of little cardboard boxes that I varnished with wallpaper glue and then mounted on whatever was at hand, or trashbags that I
filled with plaster and that I worked on with a wood die. »Further on, she decided to add to the forms the power of an irreversible gesture for
which she adopted plastic and a series of toxic materials that she cuts, burns, slashes, and sculpts.«(...) Since 1995, I love working with polystyrene that makes me think of sustainable materials such as bronze because you cannot get rid of it. (...)

Countless exhibitions have since followed in numerous galleries both in France and abroad, to include New York, Miami, Los Angeles, Aspen, Denver, Amsterdam, and Bali. He has even exhibited in the French National Assembly in Paris, in 2001.At around the same time, he also started sculpting, using this medium as a means of expression for the way in which he views the world; he infuses his subject matter with a childish inspiration and through the eyes of his own particular and unique humor.In 2009, Alain Godon originated a new artistic concept, which dovetails the ancient ancestral technique of oil on canvas with modern digital technology, and to which he ascribed the term "BildoReliefo". Unlike Andy Warhol, who colorized his photos, Alain Godon does it differently; he takes one of his paintings, which he photographs in ultra-high definition, and by de-constructing" each element of the original oil painting and then "re-constructing" the picture by adding a shadow effect, the artist creates a three-dimensional impression. Each artwork is unique and original, as it is created with its own color nuance. Printed in a limited edition of ten, each a different color, each piece is assured uniqueness and originality.

He felt the need to create, yearned to share and broadcast his joy and depict it through his work. He experimented with protean forms of expression, collage, personalizing daily objects such as motorcycle helmets, sculptures and musical instruments. Through an intense passion and limitless creativity, Aaron sketches a story and conveys an underlying message behind each of his works.

His "dollars" turn into art work, cults. One can see faces of Kate Moss, Obama, Marilyn Monroe, Charlie Chaplin or Mick Jagger on these objects, as icons. Aaron is influenced by pop-art, street art, digital and experimental works but also avant-garde works ...There are recurrent themes in his work: violins, cellos, pianos, bulldogs etc. Mass culture and consumerism are familiar territories to him, but he also turned towards other artists, such as Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Indiana not to mention Britto.
He stands out through his fantastic landscapes in dark colors, a dreamlike and poetic universe enhanced with self-deprecation.

Aaron has worked with several artists such as ZED, Eric Pottier, David David, Rakel Wajnberg and Richard Orlinski. The notion of exchange and sharing is the governing principle of his career. His career keeps progressing, through heightened sensitivity and generosity, his works are represented all around the work. For example, in May 2017, Aaron joined the hall of fame of the contemporary art scene and exhibited in New York. His works are portrayed next to Mr Brainwash, Jonone, Bruno Catalano and Speedy Graffito.

When Aaron depicts his world with passion, the common aspects are often "joyful, colorful, pop, modern and emotional." This is where the real beauty lies: inspire a great deal of optimism into life and please others. As "a painting comes alive when you look at it" said Pablo Picasso.</td>

To broach the subject, he therefore finds oblique, non linear strategies, such as this last series.

These sculptures are shaped like the anatomical parts of a man or creations which are part of his day so that he can identify himself with these without becoming a target. These are simple poetic narratives that speak for themselves-moreover it is important for me to display meticulous and quality work, so that the spectator can get a feel of the subject after having seen the general shape and then forget about it, to finally get tangled up in a universe swarming with life".

<td class='normal' valign='top'>Michaël Cailloux is a sculptor and engraver born in Paris in 1975. He works and lives in Paris.After graduating from the superior applied art Ecole Duperré in 1998, he creates with two comrades Atelier LZC. Specialized in the creation of design and textile objects. For more than 10 years they elaborate collections of printing illustrations and objects presented at Maison&Object fair, as well as unique creations for clients like Baccarat, Cartier, Habitat, Van Cleef & Arpels, S.T. Dupont...In 2009 in Paris, Michaël Cailloux goes for an artistic adventure and learns the techniques of jewels, and etching engraving. Thus was born the concept of misappropriation straight out of his imagination: Copper "mural jewels" that he calls "mural flies" accompanied by their etchings "the etching flies".The fly, symbol of life and death, is the signature of each of his creations referring to still-lives of the XVI century. His "mural jewels" are hand-shaped with patience and precision as a jeweler would do with its saw, bow or chisel. Before shaping and exposing it in a box as a jewel box, and embellish the wall and not a woman, he prints the jewel in a limited edition of 6 copies (etching, aquatint). He only works with 4 different colors from a limited range: silver, gold, Payne grey, and concentrated blue, as well for embossment in order to obtain etchings that are the print of the object.Since 2014, always under the influence of nature his favorite theme, Michaël Cailloux creates its new collection with the human body and elements of nature (flowers, insects...) In the middle of his creation of his mural jewels and engravings, he launches a collection of etching printings on leather, unveiling his new influences. He also diverts his first textile art drawings with fragments of wallpapers and 100% satin silk scarfs, all in a limited edition but with a larger range of color. Which sometimes are slightly acidulous.</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>Rosette Bir (April 9, 1926 - June 19, 1993) is a French sculptor, who practiced in Montreuil, in the Paris region.
She began to sculpt at the age of 42 when, after raising her children, she began an apprenticeship with the sculptor Albert Féraud. After her apprenticeship, she separated from the movement of her master since for her, geometric was perfection. She is therefore entirely devoted to it, following the MADI current, from South America, in the sculptural field.
His work is organized exclusively from the work of polished stainless steel. Her love for this material makes her transcend an astonishing creative will that will lead her, over time, through many progressive and innovative research. His work consists only of unique pieces. She has made sculptures of varying sizes, from the ashtray to the monumental sculpture several meters high.
His collection has toured the exhibitions, and his works have appeared in numerous articles in newspapers and magazines, specialized or not.
She died in 1993 following a car accident.

<td class='normal' valign='top'>Carlo Amen is a young visual artist and tattoo artist. Born in northern France in 1985, he grew up surrounded by two artistic parents in a house where there was paint on every door handle. It was here that he developed his appetite for the artistic world.After graduating from the Saint-Luc School of Visual Arts in Tournais, Belgium, Carlo Amen began his long journey of initiation. He left for Spain, then returned to Belgium for a short while, before heading to Europe's roads and further afield, to Great Britain, the United States, Thailand, Mexico, Tasmania and Australia. Over 10 years, he lived in 5 different countries and travelled through more than 25, before acquiring his unique style, which he likes to describe as "neo-classical with cubist inspirations". An avid globe-trotter, he finally settled in Paris, where he opened a tattoo parlour, 'Les Maux Bleus', with a friend and colleague. Like his tattoos, his paintings are simple and naïve. He finds inspiration in everyday life; in metro parishioners, gourmet cooking, spiral staircases, trampolines, people who give bread to Parisian pigeons, music from the 80s, the creativity that can be observed in contemporary dance and the kitsch of dog beauty competitions, not to mention travelling.Many of his illustrations are a nod to the Spanish master Pablo Picasso. His approach to cubism is also a way to pay tribute to the great men of the previous century such as Henri Matisse and Auguste Herbin or the paintings of Le Corbusier.</td>

APPREHEND the ?implementation of Samuel, between simplicity, evidence and complexity, it is first we get rid of our visual habits. What do we see? The subject is complex, in the fusion between a photograph which, by the treatment that it has suffered, also mixed mosaic and paint, and a mosaic of thousands of lit twigs of wood painted, of variable heights, which gives him a sculptural aspect. To the pixels of the photograph, meet those of the mosaic of wood; the two dimensions in become three.

The bas-relief thus created gives us the impression that a part of the photograph out of the frame, just to our meeting. It is here that lies the entire force of the implementation: it we happe. Was put in place a set of back-and-forth of the next to try to enter in its detail? We are approaching, mus by the envy of touch?

<td class='normal' valign='top'>Agnes Baillon is originally from around Montpellier. Politically conscious, she quickly rebelled against the military facilities and nuclear power of her region, to defend peace and freedom. Today, she lives and works in Paris, where she studied drawing and painting at École nationale supérieure des beaux-arts in 1986. 

The sculptures of the French artist, Agnes Baillon reveals unique items in resin, painted white and bronze in some areas, whose delicate accomplishment conveys a subtle play on the human physiognomy, accentuated with an almost dream-like tranquility. 

She was committed in showing the human being through a realistic eye, as she wanted to find her own way of expression, without getting intimidated by the various other well-established artistic trends. According to her, only realistic art can describe the delicate nuances of her emotional state. Then, it is the role of the spectator to understand it.

The artist used brief emotional states as the key element of her intentions, moments where a child's naivety became her own inspiration. Agnes Baillon relies on this to capture and highlight the emotional state in a wonderful manner, while managing to intuitively pass on these emotions to the spectator almost each time, till conjuring up the mystery.</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>Movement: Activist Artists




Claire Fontaine is a Paris-based collective artist, founded in 2004. 

After lifting her name from a popular brand of school notebooks, Claire Fontaine declared herself a "readymade artist" and began to elaborate a version of neo-conceptual art that often looks like other people's work. Working in neon, video, sculpture, painting and text, her practice can be described as an ongoing interrogation of the political impotence and the crisis of singularity that seem to define contemporary art today. But if the artist herself is the subjective equivalent of a urinal or a Brillo box - as displaced, deprived of its use value, and exchangeable as the products she makes - there is always the possibility of what she calls the "human strike." 

Claire Fontaine uses her freshness and youth to make herself a whatever-singularity and an existential terrorist in search of subjective emancipation. She grows up among the ruins of the notion of authorship, experimenting with collective protocols of production, détournements, and the production of various devices for the sharing of intellectual and private property.

Recent shows include, Arbeit Macht Kapital, Kubus, Städtische Galerie im Lenbachhaus und Kunstbau, München, They Hate Us For Our Freedom, Contemporary Art Museum St. Louis, Lucky In The Misfortune, Masion Descartes, Institut Français des Pays-Bas, Amsterdam, Feux de Détresse, Galerie Chantal Crousel, Paris et Claire Fontaine, The Exhibition Formerly Known as Passengers, 2.10, CCA Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts, San Franscisco. Claire Fontaine is represented by Reena Spaulings Fine Art, New York, T293, Napoli, Galerie Neu, Berlin and Galerie Chantal Crousel / Air de Paris, Paris.

She is now preparing a book around the concepts of ready-made artist and human strike.</td>
